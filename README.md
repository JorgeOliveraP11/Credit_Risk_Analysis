# Credit Risk Assessment with Advanced Data Analytics and Machine Learning
Project Overview: This project focuses on developing and implementing advanced credit risk assessment models that leverage in machine learning and data analytics techniques

## Overview
This project aims to enhance credit risk assessment using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. By developing robust models, we seek to improve the accuracy of credit risk predictions and optimize lending decisions.

## Features
- Data Validation: Inspection of the data set, data types, identifying and filling missing values.
- Exploratory Analysis: Identifying correlation between features, features distribution, relationship between target variable and categorical variables and detail the main findings.
- Feature Engineering: Creation of informative features for model development.
- Model Development: Building and testing of machine learning models for credit risk assessment.
- Model Validation: Validation of models using historical data and cross-validation techniques.
- Final Summary and Recomendations: Details of the recommendations for the business.

## Installation
